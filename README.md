# Aliceboard

The aliceboard is a project that I started as a project to be able see how much I could learn in a month with zero prior knowledge, especially in kicad and fusion. Both these tools were things that I had heard a lot about but never once touched. Seeing that creating a custom keyboard seemed to be a good fit, I sat down and spent some time working towards this project.
